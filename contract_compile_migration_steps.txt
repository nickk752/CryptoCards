TRUFFLE COMPILE
All contracts are located in project's conracts/ directory.
Change to root directory where the project is located.

$ truffle compile

Compiles all contracts if upon first run. Upon subsequent runs,
only contracts that have changed will be compiled.

TRUFFLE MIGRATIONS
Migration scripts help deploy contracts to the Ethereum network.

To run migrations:

$ truffle migrate

This will run all migrations in migrations/ directory.
For local testing, make sure ganache is installed and 
running before executing migrate.

You have to have at least two migration files.
The first is an initial migration that that deploys the Migrations.sol
(1_initial_migration.js)
Then you can create migration files to deploy your other contracts.
(2_deploy_some_contract.js)
